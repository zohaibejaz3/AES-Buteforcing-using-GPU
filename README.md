# AES-Buteforcing-using-GPU

This project aims to exploit the fact that AES is a symmetric key protocol by brute forcing the key using known/chosen plaintext attacks. As brute forcing is quite a taxing solution to this problem, a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) will be used for this task which will allow for many parallel attempts at brute forcing the key. The project will start off by attempting to brute force the last 32-bits out of the 128-bit key. If that works out, a ciphertext only attack can be implemented using some sort of a file that contains potential plaintexts which attacks more than 32-bits of the 128-bit key in any configuration (not just the last). The goal of the project to see just how powerful and dangerous parallel processing can be. This project will be implemented using C++ and CUDA.
